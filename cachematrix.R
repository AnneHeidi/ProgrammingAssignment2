## Cache: a Place to store something temporarily in a computing environment

## overall description of what the functions do: 
    # MakeCacheMatrix makes a list containing a function to set the value of a matrix (x), get the value of the matrix
    # and to Set the value of the inversematrix (inverseM) and get the value of the inversematrix 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
